# Notes App

## Project Overview

**Notes App** is a full-stack note-taking application that allows users to create, manage, and store notes securely. The application features a user-friendly interface and a robust backend. Built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (via Mongoose), it aims to provide a reliable experience for users to organize their thoughts efficiently.

## Installation

To set up the Notes App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/notes-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd notes-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure it with your credentials for Firebase and MongoDB. The file should look like this:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=yourmongodburi
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=yourfirebaseprojectid
   FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=yourfirebaseprivatekey
   FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=yourfirebaseclientemail
   ```

## Usage

To start the application, you can use the following commands:

- For production:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

- For development (with automatic restart on changes):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

After starting the server, the application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. You can access the frontend from your web browser and start creating notes.
